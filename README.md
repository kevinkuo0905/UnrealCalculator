# Unreal Calculator

This is a demo calculator that supports complex number operations, graphing utilities, and symbolic algebraic manipulation through abstract syntax trees.

Built with React and the MathJAX library for displaying math expressions.

Heroku deployment: https://unreal-calculator.herokuapp.com/

Note that it doesn't work at all on Safari because it has lookbehind assertions. I will convert the calculations to a simple server. 

Will add documentation for usage and supported functions soon.
